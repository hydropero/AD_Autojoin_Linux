# AD_Autojoin_Linux - Ansible Tower

# This repo contains the **Ansible Tower** files required to perform an automated domain join of a **RHEL** server into **Active Directory**. 

This process is not only tedious and time consuming, normally IP changes due to DHCP are not tracked within internal DNS, this is needlessly painful and doubly so for those who use who futz with their home networking on a weekly basis or equally certifiable, those who run RHEL as their daily driver. (You never know when you'll need to SSH from across your apartment, just to avoid some much need exercise!)
